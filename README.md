CityOfPetalumaResolutions
=========================
This is the original governing resolution for the creation of the Technology and Telecommunications Advisory Committee for the City of Petaluma. This committee was formed in March 2005. The City Council evenutally changed the name of the committee to Technology Advisory Committee in June 2011. The resolution discussing that name change is also included. That they are in scanned from print PDF speaks to why we need a better system of writing legislation. (No angels were harmed in the posting of these PDFs.)
